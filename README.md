# Adaptive_Cruise_Control
An Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) for autonmous model-cars navigate using Virtual Force Field (VFF) approach.
The adaptive cruise control has two inputs (Delta distance and relative speed) and its output is acceleration.
The accelration is fed to a low-level-control to get a speed comand value that can be send to the motor.
The system has been presented in ROBOVIS 2020. The paper that describe the system can be called through the link:

A short video that show the system performance on a model-car can be called from the link bellow:
